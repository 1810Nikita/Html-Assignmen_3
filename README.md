# Html-Assignmen_3

In this Question I have created the form using input type radio and check box.
when the screen size is smaller than 600 pixels, the layout changes to display elements vertically. This way, the form will still be easy to read and use on smaller screens.
for adjusting two elements in one line i have used css flex.
